      <h3>Model S: Where Luxury Meets Power</h3>
      <p>The Model S is the oldest of the four main Tesla models. That certainly does not mean it's slow. It is the fastest Tesla, and each year it competes for the title of 'Quickest Production Car in the World', meaning it has among the fastest 0-60 times on the market (depending on which 'mode' you get, it can be under two seconds). Being an electric car helps it reach the quickness of a sports car.</p>
      <p>Just because the company has put extensive time and energy into the motor doesn't mean the driving experience suffers at all. You can find carbon fiber-lined interiors, heated seats, and premium audio systems. The technology of the car is revolutionary, never before seen in any other vehicle.</p>

      <h3>Famous Features</h3>
      <p>Tesla cars are well-known for a variety of reasons. They are virtually silent, they have a frunk (front trunk), and a huge iPad-like entertainment unit in the middle. This touchscreen tablet is used to control basically every aspect of the car (except steering). It can adjust the climate, raise/lower suspension, play video games, and stream video from Netflix or YouTube (only available while parked, as to not distract the driver). Sentry Mode is a state-of-the-art security system that detects people nearby and turns on cameras to record. When the car is locked, even the door handles retract into the door, making it incredibly difficult to break in. Another well-known feature is the ability for the car to drive itself to you from a parking spot with nobody inside. While this is only available in short distances at low speeds, the autopilot feature is world-renowned, which lets you get from point A to point B while only having to keep a hand on the steering wheel periodically (to prevent the driver from falling asleep).</p>

		  <h4>Model S</h4>
		</a>
      <p>The Model S is the oldest, and fastest of the four models. It is one of the two 'premium' models, along with the Model X. It also has the longest range (battery life).</p>

		  <h4>Model 3</h4>
		</a>
      <p>The Model 3 is a sedan like the Model S, but it is a much cheaper (almost half the price) model because it is not a premium one. It is by far the cheapest,  but still very fast (3.1 0-60).</p>

		  <h4>Model X</h4>
		</a>
      <p>The Model X is Tesla's premium SUV, with much of the technology of the Model S while holding a ton of cargo and passenger space. It's the most expensive Tesla baseline option.</p>

		  <h4>Model Y</h4>
		</a>
      <p>The Model Y is Tesla's newest model, released in 2020. It's considered to be part of the Model 3 family, much like the Models S &amp; X share their specs. It's the slowest  model (3.5 0-60).</p>
