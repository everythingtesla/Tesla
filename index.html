      <h3>Tesla Motors</h3>
      <p>Tesla was founded in 2003 in San Carlos, California, right in the heart of Silicon Valley and the Bay Area. From the beginning, they have set themselves apart from other car manufacturers by being a technology company and revolutionizing car amenities. They are focused on reducing climate change by making electric cars more appealing and more accessible to the mass public. All four baseline models frequently drop in price, sometimes being cut by up to $10,000.</p>
      <p>Tesla has four main models of cars, those being the Model S, Model 3, Model X, and Model Y. The Models S &amp; 3 are sedans, while Models X &amp; Y are considered SUVs. All four are widely known for the luxury and technology that are incorporated into even the cheapest models. Tesla has always wanted its cars to not just keep up with traditional gas cars, but exceed them in terms of performance, comfort, and overall appeal.</p>

		  <h4>Model S</h4>
		</a>
      <p>The Model S is the oldest, and fastest of the four models. It is one of the two 'premium' models, along with the Model X. It also has the longest range (battery life).</p>

		  <h4>Model 3</h4>
		</a>
      <p>The Model 3 is a sedan like the Model S, but it is a much cheaper (almost half the price) model because it is not a premium one. It is by far the cheapest,  but still very fast (3.1 0-60).</p>

		  <h4>Model X</h4>
		</a>
      <p>The Model X is Tesla's premium SUV, with much of the technology of the Model S while holding a ton of cargo and passenger space. It's the most expensive Tesla baseline option.</p>

      	<a href="Model_Y.html">
		  <h4>Model Y</h4>
		</a>
      <p>The Model Y is Tesla's newest model, released in 2020. It's considered to be part of the Model 3 family, much like the Models S &amp; X share their specs. It's the slowest  model (3.5 0-60).</p>
