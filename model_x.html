      <h3>Model X: A Thrill Ride for Many</h3>
      <p>The Model X is another premium Tesla vehicle. It is the most expensive base price, because it combines the power and luxury of the Model S with the capacity of the Model Y. Where the sedans impressed many with their capacity and storage space, the SUVs like the Model X take it a step further.</p>
      <p>In terms of power, well, the Model X set a World Record by towing a <i>plane</i> over 1,000ft. That's over 128 tons, or 287,000lb. If any vehicle could've moved the hammer <i>Mj√∂lnir</i> in <i>Thor</i>, it would've been this one.</p>

      <h3>Famous Features</h3>
      <p>Probably the most famous feature of the Model X is the falcon-wing passenger doors. Not only are they incredible to see, but there is a lot of technology behind them. This includes sensors that make it virtually impossible to crush your hand or anything else that you accidently leave in its way, as well as mechanisms that make the doors lift straight up so you don't hit anything, even in tight parking spaces or garages. Along with this, the Model X also features the most advanced sound system in a Tesla, with the same layout as the Model S, but it holds more speakers because it is a bigger vehicle. You've still got all of the classic Tesla features like incredible speed, very little noise, a huge vertical touchscreen, and autopilot capabilities. Like all Tesla automobiles, this car is truly fascinating.</p>

		  <h4>Model S</h4>

      <p>The Model S is the oldest, and fastest of the four models. It is one of the two 'premium' models, along with the Model X. It also has the longest range (battery life).</p>

		  <h4>Model 3</h4>
		</a>
      <p>The Model 3 is a sedan like the Model S, but it is a much cheaper (almost half the price) model because it is not a premium one. It is by far the cheapest,  but still very fast (3.1 0-60).</p>

		  <h4>Model X</h4>

      <p>The Model X is Tesla's premium SUV, with much of the technology of the Model S while holding a ton of cargo and passenger space. It's the most expensive Tesla baseline option.</p>

		  <h4>Model Y</h4>
		</a>
      <p>The Model Y is Tesla's newest model, released in 2020. It's considered to be part of the Model 3 family, much like the Models S &amp; X share their specs. It's the slowest  model (3.5 0-60).</p>
