      <h3>Model 3: Amazing Cars Don't Have to Cost $50,000</h3>
      <p>The Model 3 can be considered the 'little brother' of the Model S. It is certainly one of the most luxurious cars in the world, but the price tag frequently drops (currently below $40,000). It doesn't have <i>all</i> of the features of the Model S, but it is the cheapest Tesla on the market and much more affordable for those who are looking to buy a high-end car.</p>
      <p> As a result of this, the Model 3 has been the best-selling plug-in electric car in the world for three years straight (it came out in 2017 and within a year, skyrocketed to the top), and the best-selling electric car in history. It's as though everyone wants a taste of the Tesla experience at a price they can afford.</p>

      <h3>Famous Features</h3>
      <p>Surprisingly, although about half the price, the Model 3 has many of the same features as the Model S (likely a reason why it is so popular). The Model 3 also has a frunk, is incredibly quiet, and has autopilot capabilites. It is wicked fast and also revolves around its main tablet in the front. The Model 3 tablet is horizontal (landscape) like a TV or computer monitor rather than vertical (like an iPad) like the Model S. However, both screens are big and clear and control most aspects of the car. If you're looking for an electric sedan but don't have Elon Musk-level funds, the Model 3 may be the best way to go in order to get the car you've been looking for.</p>

		  <h4>Model S</h4>

      <p>The Model S is the oldest, and fastest of the four models. It is one of the two 'premium' models, along with the Model X. It also has the longest range (battery life).</p>

		  <h4>Model 3</h4>
		</a>
      <p>The Model 3 is a sedan like the Model S, but it is a much cheaper (almost half the price) model because it is not a premium one. It is by far the cheapest,  but still very fast (3.1 0-60).</p>

		  <h4>Model X</h4>
		</a>
      <p>The Model X is Tesla's premium SUV, with much of the technology of the Model S while holding a ton of cargo and passenger space. It's the most expensive Tesla baseline option.</p>

		  <h4>Model Y</h4>
		</a>
      <p>The Model Y is Tesla's newest model, released in 2020. It's considered to be part of the Model 3 family, much like the Models S &amp; X share their specs. It's the slowest  model (3.5 0-60).</p>
