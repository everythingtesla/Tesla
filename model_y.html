      <h3>Model Y: The Rising Star</h3>
      <p>The Model Y is the youngest of the Tesla models, dating back to just 2020. It shares many of its components with the Model 3, but its main draw is its capacity and affordability. The long-range model compares to that of the Model X, but comes in about $40,000 cheaper. Like the Model X, it is more expensive than its sedan brother (Model 3), but there is a ton of space to go around.</p>
      <p>The Model Y can best be described as Tesla's 'everything car' or the company's ultimate compromise. You've got power, space, affordability, and technology all wrapped up in one. If you're looking for a Tesla that has a little bit of everything, the Model Y is for you. Expect the Model Y to take off in sales as Tesla continues to slash their prices and people look for a balance between space, cost, and luxury.</p>

      <h3>Famous Features</h3>
      <p>As noted above, rather than bring a unique feature to the table, the Model Y excels because it gathers what the other models do best and put it all into one. You're still getting one of the most technologically advanced cars ever. You still get software updates periodically that continue to bring new features to the software. The beauty of a Tesla is that it doesn't just get old like other cars, it gets better as time passes. Autopilot is an ever-evolving concept that becomes smarter and more reliable with each update. Tesla takes in sample points from its cars on the road to teach its software how to act in certain situations. The Model Y is a perfect example of what makes Tesla amazing.</p>

		  <h4>Model S</h4>

      <p>The Model S is the oldest, and fastest of the four models. It is one of the two 'premium' models, along with the Model X. It also has the longest range (battery life).</p>

		  <h4>Model 3</h4>
		</a>
      <p>The Model 3 is a sedan like the Model S, but it is a much cheaper (almost half the price) model because it is not a premium one. It is by far the cheapest,  but still very fast (3.1 0-60).</p>

		  <h4>Model X</h4>

      <p>The Model X is Tesla's premium SUV, with much of the technology of the Model S while holding a ton of cargo and passenger space. It's the most expensive Tesla baseline option.</p>

		  <h4>Model Y</h4>
		</a>
      <p>The Model Y is Tesla's newest model, released in 2020. It's considered to be part of the Model 3 family, much like the Models S &amp; X share their specs. It's the slowest  model (3.5 0-60).</p>
